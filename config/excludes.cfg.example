# Loki-RS Exclusions Configuration
# 
# This file contains regular expressions that are applied to file paths
# during scanning. Each line represents a regex pattern that will exclude
# matching paths from being scanned.
#
# Examples:
#   ^/proc/.*          - Exclude everything under /proc
#   ^/dev/.*           - Exclude everything under /dev
#   ^/sys/.*           - Exclude everything under /sys
#   .*\.log$           - Exclude all .log files
#   .*/tmp/.*          - Exclude everything in tmp directories
#   .*node_modules.*   - Exclude node_modules directories
#
# Note: Patterns are matched against the full file path, not just the filename.

# System directories (Linux)
^/proc/.*
^/dev/.*
^/sys/.*
^/run/.*
^/var/run/.*

# Temporary files
.*\.tmp$
.*\.temp$
.*\.swp$
.*\.bak$

# Log files (uncomment if you want to exclude logs)
# .*\.log$
# .*\.log\.[0-9]+$

# Cache directories (uncomment if needed)
# .*\.cache/.*
# .*/cache/.*
